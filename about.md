![image-left](/assets/me.jpg){: .align-left} Hi there, I'm Clint.

I've been fooling around with computers for a pretty long time now, and I think it's fair to say I'm pretty hooked.

I left the heady heights of London to be closer to family during the tail-end of 2017; since then I've decided to set out down the route of consultancy, contracting and all those lovely synonyms used to describe working for oneself.

This site is where I'll be posting my musings, exploration in tech, information on the company and availability and possibly even the odd cheeky blog post on the usual nonsense that life brings.

Aside from being a developer, I also possess the following wonderful qualities:

* I can truly smash a Netflix binge
* I'm a pretty awesome cook
* I enjoy gaming
* I enjoy acting like I'm not a filthy casual when it comes to gaming
* I was once called a t*** by none other than the wonderful Jo Brand after accidentally bumping into her in the street
